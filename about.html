		<p>
			Fashion icons like Playboi Carti, Young Thug and migos style is misunderstood.<br>
			I look up to anyone authentic, these type of icons is the definition of authentic.<br>
			They really raise the bar when it comes to style, these are the type of trends needed in the new generation and it's what inspired this website.
